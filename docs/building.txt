GoldED+ compilation how to
by Alexander Aganichev, 2:5020/201.58 <asa@eed.miee.ru>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile GoldED+ and utilities you'll need:

 - GNU C++ newer than 2.8.x, gcc 2.95.2 recommended
 - GNU make and GNU sed
 - vi, emacs, or any other editor you like
 - boldness ;-)

First, edit GNUmakef.def for the preferrable compilation options.

Now go to golded3 and áopy mygolded.__h to mygolded.h and adjust it for
yourself (put your name, FTN address and e-mail). Goto root again.

Pray.

Exec 'make'. Wait. (If your version of gcc does not support strftime format
checking you will need to manually comment __attribute__ definition on
strftimei function in goldlib/gall/gtimall.h.)

ls bin/

You have to get ged{short-patform-name}, gn{short-patform-name}, and
rddt{short-patform-name}. If so, you did it!
