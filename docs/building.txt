GoldED+ compilation how to
by Alexander Aganichev, 2:5020/201.58 <aaganichev@netscape.net>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile GoldED+ and utilities you'll need:

 - GNU C++ newer than 2.8.x, gcc 2.95.2 recommended
 - GNU make and GNU sed
 - vi, emacs, or any other editor you like
 - beer or bear on your choice ;-)

--- MINGW32 ONLY ---
Remove alloc.h from the $(include)/mingw32 to avoid unpredictable problems.
Change arguments to sopen (to be `const char *' instead of `char *') and
atexit (to be `void (func *)(void)' instead of `void (func *)()').
------ COMMON ------

First, edit GNUmakef.def for the preferrable compilation options.

Now go to golded3 and copy mygolded.__h to mygolded.h and adjust it for
yourself (put your name, FTN address and e-mail). Goto root again.

Exec 'make' (or `gmake' on BSD) and drink beer or play with bear until
compilation in progress.

ls bin/

You have to get ged{short-patform-name}, gn{short-patform-name}, and
rddt{short-patform-name}. If so, you did it!
