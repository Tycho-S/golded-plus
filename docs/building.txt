GoldED+ compilation howto
by Alexander Aganichev, 2:5020/201.58 <aaganichev@netscape.net>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile GoldED+ and utilities you'll need:

 - GNU C++ newer than 2.8.x, gcc 2.95.2 recommended
 - GNU make and GNU sed
 - vi, emacs, or any other editor you like
 - beer or bear on your choice ;-)

--- MINGW ONLY ---
Please consult this howto on installing MinGW over Cygwin:

------ COMMON ------

First, edit GNUmakef.def for the preferrable compilation options.

Now go to golded3 and copy mygolded.__h to mygolded.h and adjust it for
yourself (put your name, FTN address and e-mail). Goto root again.

Exec 'make' (or `gmake' on BSD) and drink beer or play with bear until
compilation in progress. But better - help your wife (if you have one) or
wives (if you have more :)) with home work ;-)

ls bin/

You have to get ged{short-patform-name}, gn{short-patform-name}, and
rddt{short-patform-name}. If so, you did it!
