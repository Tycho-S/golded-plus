GoldED+ compilation howto
by Alexander Aganichev, 2:5020/201.58 <aaganichev@netscape.net>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile GoldED+ and utilities you'll need:

 - GNU C++ newer than 2.8.x, gcc 2.95.2 recommended
 - GNU make and GNU sed
 - vi, emacs, or any other editor you like
 - beer or bear on your choice ;-)

--- MINGW ONLY ---
Please consult this howto on installing MinGW over Cygwin:
http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/mno-cygwin-howto.txt
--- gcc-2.95.3-5.tar.bz2 + mingw-runtime-1.3-2.tar.bz2 ---
Move /usr/include/mingw to /usr/local/include/mingw, take gcc-2.95.3-xxx.tar.gz
from www.mingw.org, copy .../lib/stdlibc++.a to /usr/local/lib/mingw, copy
.../include/g++-3 to /usr/local/include/mingw/g++-3.
------ COMMON ------

First, edit GNUmakef.def for the preferrable compilation options.

Now go to golded3 and copy mygolded.__h to mygolded.h and adjust it for
yourself (put your name, FTN address and e-mail). Goto root again.

Exec 'make' (or `gmake' on BSD) and drink beer or play with bear until
compilation in progress. But better - help your wife (if you have one) or
wives (if you have more :)) with home work ;-)

ls bin/

You have to get ged{short-patform-name}, gn{short-patform-name}, and
rddt{short-patform-name}. If so, you did it!

When building in DJGPP environment you may wish to patch libc with djlocale
patch which may be found on http://asa.i-connect.com/djlocale.zip. This patch
intended for those who worried about NLS support.
