folders.

GoldED+ plans. As always there's no any guarantee of feature
implementation order and that to do list will be implemented at all.
Any help will be appreciated.

To do:

* Deleting Synchronet messages, forward reply linking.
* Add Synchronet message base support (aim for 1.1.5).
* AreaYouWroteTo should be able to store copy of mail after change.
* Optionally add complete set of fidonet kludges to AreaIsEmail.
* E-mail/news signature support (or it already present? :))
* SMTP support.
* Refresh message header after calling externutil.
* Try to save position in message after printing, changing xlat table,
  etc.
* Major xlat/recode engine update (in progress).
* CUI in input prompts.
* Activating built-in MIME-QP convertor by key (on whole message).
* Postpone.
* Highlight up to 3 groups of users by different color.
* Implicit address completion in addressbook.
* Addressbook sorting in various ways.
* Addressbook <-> macrofile synchronization
* Mouse support
* Better threading support.
* Read unread messages (either will be done via selection of unread
  messages or when storing of unread status will be implemented).
* Add separators to Arealistformat, i.e. Arealistformat "A|E|G".
* Entering to locked area should allow to select another area instead.
* CODEPAGE kludge support.
* Message text preprocessing with externutil.
* Add *.* to attach path if not specified.
* Marking messages with reply in lister.

To fix:

* UUdecoder not 100% reliable: any volunteers for uulib maintaining?
* Need some workarounds on -install feature under Linux (UNIX).
* Win32 (only when runned under Win9x) version does not support case
  insensitive search of regexp's for high part of ASCII table. That's
  a limitation of Microsoft CRTL, I can't do anything easy for that
  but probably someday I provide a huge patch (I wonder if Microsoft
  accept patches? =))...

Known wishes that not currently planned (any volunteers?):

* Interactive Twit-list edition.
* Pass areaname, message number, etc. to external utility.
* Hide empty areas / areas without new messages from arealist.
* NNTP support.
* Forward multiple messages.
* Peeking up message from area while in edit mode.
* Screen grabber.
* Language support for menu (ReadMainMenu).
* Mark areas with unsent mail.
* Trashcan for mail.
* Selection of codepage for outgoing message.
* Ability to change directory in attach picker.
* Any of your suggestion may be placed here ;-)
